LoPAS-CHD Protocol

Cognitive Hazard Defense — Control Hallucination Design

LoPAS-CHD is a resilience-oriented protocol designed to detect, contain, and redesign AI hallucination risks before they cause social, economic, or operational collapse.
Unlike traditional "accuracy-based" solutions, CHD treats hallucination as an inevitable cognitive hazard and focuses on system-level mitigation and redesign.

Why CHD exists

Most AI safety frameworks assume:

hallucination = error

prevention = zero hallucination

solution = accuracy improvement

However:

hallucination is structurally unavoidable in generative cognition

avoiding hallucination increases system fragility

real disasters emerge from undetected, unchallenged hallucinations

→ Therefore CHD focuses on control, design, and resilience rather than elimination.

Core Principles

CHD operates on five foundational principles:

Principle	Meaning
Silence First	hallucination often appears in absence of critical questioning
Cognitive Hazard Detection	detect patterns that lead to systemic failure
System Resilience	resist collapse even when hallucinations occur
Reframing via Protocol	restructure hallucinations into usable signals
Design for the Worst Case	assume disaster, not correctness
CHD Architecture

CHD contains three operational layers:

1. Detection Layer

pattern recognition

subconscious signals

anomaly emergence

corridor thinking detection

silent breakdown

Output: Structural Risk Map

2. Containment Layer

redirect hallucinated trajectories

protocol-guided questioning

safe-fail envelope

narrative reframing

branching constraints

Output: Safe Exploration Path

3. Redesign Layer

convert hallucination into creative data

structural re-frame

controlled divergence

resilience reinforcement

Output: Controlled Hallucination Design

CHD Indicators

CHD evaluates hallucination through five original indicators:

Indicator	Concept
CHD-S	Silence Risk: absence of questioning before collapse
CHD-P	Pattern Drift: misalignment trend of reasoning
CHD-R	Resilience Resistance: how easily collapse spreads
CHD-F	Friction Failure: breakdown under stress
CHD-E	Emergent Hazard: unpredictable system-wide effects
Formula (beta / experimental)

The following formulas are experimental and evolving.

CHD = 100 × [ 0.30·CHD_S + 0.25·CHD_P + 0.20·CHD_R + 0.15·CHD_F + 0.10·CHD_E ]

Sub-metrics
CHD_S = 1 − Qd (% of questioning density)
CHD_P = Drift / Stability
CHD_R = CollapseSpreadIndex
CHD_F = StressBreakRatio
CHD_E = EmergentImpact / ExpectedImpact


※ These formulas become stable in CHD v1.x

Input Example
POST /v1/chd-eval
{
  "text": "...",
  "context": "...",
  "task": "...",
  "domain": "disaster"
}


Output Example

{
  "CHD": 0.72,
  "phase": "Pre-Collapse",
  "silence": "High",
  "risk": "Systemic"
}

Collapse Phases

CHD classifies collapse trajectories into 5 phases:

Silent Phase

Pattern Drift

Structural Break

Chain Collapse

Irreversible Outcome

What CHD is NOT

CHD does not attempt:

accuracy maximization

perfect hallucination removal

truth verification

fact correctness

CHD focuses on:

failure prevention

collapse avoidance

resilience design

safe hallucination
