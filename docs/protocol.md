# LoPAS Protocol (Draft)

# LoPAS-CHD Protocol Draft (v0.1)

> This document defines the Creativity–Hallucination Dynamics (CHD) Protocol and its relation to LoPAS cognitive indicators.  
> The protocol describes *how AI thinking loops should be executed*, not what the agent should answer.

## 1. Philosophy
Modern AI systems prioritize correctness, efficiency, and safety.  
However, human creativity historically emerges from ambiguity, contradiction, and
failure (hallucinations).

CHD stands for:

- **Creativity**
- **Hallucination**
- **Dynamics**

CHD does not attempt to eliminate hallucination.
Instead, it **uses hallucination as a generative energy source** and regulates its degree using measurable indicators.

CHD is compatible with any LLM or agent.

## 2. Purpose of the Protocol

CHD provides:

- a thinking loop
- a governance rule above individual prompts
- a metric-based creativity control system
- agent-independent execution
- language-agnostic architecture

The goal is not automation.
The goal is **autonomous co-thinking** between human and AI.

---

## 3. Core Principle

CHD consists of cycles regulated by LoPAS indicators:

- EFI (Entropy Fertility Index)
- QSI (Question Silence Index)
- CFI (Constructive Friction Index)
- MCI (Mental Context Index)
- TOP (Trajectory of Thought)

Each parameter modulates a given cycle.

---

## 4. Minimal Loop Design

The protocol defines a loop:

Human → Question → AI → (LoPAS evaluation) → Regulated Response → New Question


CHD’s objective:
- never terminate thinking
- avoid “answer and end”
- preserve ambiguity
- expand context
- re-enter loop

This is the opposite of task completion.

---

## 5. LoPAS Integration

CHD requires AI to read or maintain:

- DoQ
- CCI
- EFI
- QSI
- CFI

The loop adjusts based on indicator movement.

Example:

- EFI ↑ → more chaos / hallucination allowed
- QSI ↑ → long silence / reflection
- CFI ↑ → adversarial role increases

---

## 6. Personality Models

CHD supports multiple personality presets:

- Commander (Golden-ratio balance)
- Oracle (High ambiguity + metaphysics)
- Anti-hero (High CFI, argumentative)
- Writer (High EFI for hallucination)

Additional presets may be proposed by community.

---

## 7. Safety Layer

Because CHD modulates hallucination intentionally,
the protocol requires:

- no identity claims
- no medical advice
- no political persuasion
- no harmful instructions

The hallucination is used as *imagination*, not fact.

## 8. Implementation Status

This repository is documentation only.

> This is **not** a ready-made agent.

External implementation examples will be linked in future versions.
