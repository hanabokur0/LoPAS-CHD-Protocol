# LoPAS Indicators (Draft)

This document defines the core LoPAS indicator family used in CHD-LoPAS Protocol.
The full mathematical specifications and implementation notes will be published gradually.

## 1. DoQ — Density of Question
**Definition**
Measures the depth, quality and continuity of questions within thinking processes.

**Components**
- Quantity of questions
- Structural relevance
- Context depth
- Impact on next questions

**Range**
0.00 – 1.00

---

## 2. CCI — Cognitive Connectivity Index
**Definition**
Measures semantic connection strength between concepts, layers and contexts.

**Core elements**
- Strength
- Density
- Retention
- Directionality
- Transferability

---

## 3. RDI — Reasoning Divergence Index
**Definition**
Measures how many alternative reasoning paths are generated and integrated.

**Elements**
- Number of branches
- Distance between branches
- Integration ability
- Local depth

---

## 4. HRI — Hypothesis Reframing Index
**Definition**
Measures the ability to turn failure into new hypotheses and continue exploration.

**Elements**
- Failure recognition
- Reframing speed
- Creativity of new hypothesis
- Continuation ability

---

## 5. TRS — Total Resonant Score
**Definition**
Measures cognitive and emotional resonance across agents, contexts and time.

**Purpose**
Predict long-term sustainability of thinking and cooperation.

---

## 6. SCI — Structural Collapse Index
**Definition**
Reverse index that measures collapse probability of a system.

**Reverse components**
- Connectivity weakness (inverse CCI)
- Question absence (inverse DoQ)
- Divergence lack (inverse RDI)
- Reframing failure (inverse HRI)
- Recovery impossibility (inverse TRS)

---

## 7. RVI — Repair Value Index
**Definition**
Measures socio-cultural value of repair activities instead of extraction.

**Factors**
- physical repair
- cultural value
- economic circulation
- resonance
- sustainability

---

## 8. AHI — Altruism Harvest Index
**Definition**
Measures how altruistic actions return meaningfully over long periods of time.

**Elements**
- direct effect
- indirect effect
- self-satisfaction
- long-term ripple
