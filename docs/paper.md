# LoPAS-CHD Whitepaper (Draft, v0.1)
by hanabokur0 (2025)

This document presents the conceptual foundation of LoPAS (Local-Personal AI System)
and CHD (Controlled Hallucination Design).  

LoPAS-CHD is NOT an AI agent product.  
It is a **protocol** describing thinking structure and civilization trajectory.

---

## Abstract

Modern AI development prioritizes efficiency, task completion, and hallucination
elimination. LoPAS-CHD instead focuses on **cognitive process quality**, not
task output.  

The goal is not “correct answers,” but **resilient thinking**, measured by high
dimensional indicators: DoQ, CCI, TRS, SCI, etc.

---

## 1. Introduction

We propose a new framework for evaluating human-AI dialogue beyond correctness
and efficiency. This framework measures **structural cognition** and enables
controlled divergence rather than hallucination suppression.

LoPAS-CHD treats conversation as a **thinking camera system**, not a Q&A channel.

---

## 2. Background

Existing AI focuses on:
- completion
- correctness
- suppression of hallucinations
- friction removal
- alignment

LoPAS-CHD introduces:
- controlled hallucination (EFI)
- constructive friction (CFI)
- structural silence (QSI)
- multi-camera cognition

---

## 3. Core Thesis

LoPAS-CHD claims:
- thinking = multi-camera process
- hallucination = fuel
- friction = design object
- collapse = measurable
- value = resonance
- civilization = reversible

and proposes **TOP** (Thinking Orbit Protocol).

---

## 4. Metrics (summary)

- DoQ: Density of Questions
- CCI: Cognitive Connectivity Index
- RDI: Reasoning Divergence Index
- HRI: Hypothesis Reframing Index
- TRS: Total Resonant Score
- SCI: Structural Collapse Index
- RVI: Repair Value Index
- CDI: Concentration Distribution Index
- AHI: Altruism-Harvest Index

## 5. Protocol Design

LoPAS is a protocol, not a library.  
Any agent or LLM may implement it.  

No mandatory model.
No mandatory cloud.

Goal: **sovereign cognition**.

---

## 6. Controlled Hallucination Design (CHD)

CHD defines:
- QSI (Quiet Structural Inquiry)
- EFI (Emergent Fertile Imagination)
- CFI (Constructive Friction Injection)

We design hallucination, not suppress it.

---

## 7. TOP (Thinking Orbit Protocol)

TOP = LoPAS + CHD  
A self-sustaining thinking loop:
observe → imagine → diverge → reconnect → observe

## 8. Implementation Notes

Future:
- WebAssembly
- Edge inference
- Local agents
- Private cloud
- Personal nodes
- Civic deployment

---

## 9. Conclusion

LoPAS-CHD is a counter-movement to “perfect answer AI.”
We build **thinking**, not automation.
